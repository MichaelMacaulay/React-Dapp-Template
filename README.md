# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

<<<<<<< HEAD
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
=======
This project is a template using React, Hardhat, Ethers.js, Solidity, and Tailwind.css for styling.

Everything is pre-configured so you can start building as fast as possible.
